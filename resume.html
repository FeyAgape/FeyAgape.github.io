        <h1>Personal Profile</h1>
        <h3>I am a junior software developer, who specialize in Web and Android development.</h3>
        <p>I feel I am a people person. It has been noted that I am a hardworking, personable, pragmatic, approachable and enthusiastic professional.</p>
        <p>I am always up for a challenge and also eager to learn and develop new skills to achieve the highest standards, for example, while at the Co-op, I took part in Agile training to improve and introduce a more Agile way of working, which I think has improved my ability to respond far more quickly to change and provide a way to implement high-priority initiatives.</p>
        <p>I can lead and boost morale when required, as being outgoing is one of my best traits, therefore I am able to work with and understand people from all different levels and backgrounds meaning I am able to fit into various different teams.</p>
        <p>I am also able to manage multiple priorities, and build strong relationships with partners and stakeholders both internal and external, has these are skills have been able to develop and build on while working at the Co-op.</p>
        <p>I am also highly motivated and career driven, hence why I joined Aspire (Co-op Women Career network) while at the Co-op because I am someone who is proactive and take ownership of my own personal development and career progression.</p>
        <p>I am a self-taught Web developer, currently focusing on front end development and aspiring to be a Full Stack developer and Android Developer by the end of the year. I am currently also learning Android Development via Udacity thanks to a Google scholarship I received at the start of the year in January.</p>

 <h1>Voluntary Work</h1>
<h3>I am also someone that likes to get involved because I have a genuine commitment to social impact.</h3>
<p>While in University I volunteered in a local charity shop for animals within my first two years, which I really enjoyed and
  I was able to learn a lot about the local community.</p> 
<p>At the Co-op, I have been involved in a few community projects and fundraising. In 2016, I organize and lead a massive clean-up in Boggart Hole Park, which also made the local paper. I also organized a fundraising 'Charity Shop' event in 1 Angel Square which raise over £700. And in October 2016, I was part of Team Droylsden Co-op Apprenticeship challenge, where we were the winner of the ‘greatest increase in shop takings’.</p>

<div class="coltwo">
 <h1>Work Experience and Placement</h1>

<p>My first official work experience came while at High School as part of year 10 compulsory work experience. The experience gave me care assistant and hospitality skills, and I learned how to interact with older and disabled people in a friendly, efficient, respectful and timely manner.</p> 
<p>Through-out the year 2008 and 2009 I worked as a teaching assistant and nursery nurse as part of a work placement for my college course where I worked 400 unpaid hours.</p>
