                                        <p>My passion for Web development started at my previous role, working for the Co-op Group, when my manager gave me a website project to have a look at, to see what needed updating and how to go about making the new changes. This was how I got a taste for developing and I realized I wanted to learn more. </p>
                                        <p>I did Front-End Web development for a year at the Co-op, website (Internet and Intranet) content updating and creating via Episerver CMS (The Co-op's content management system). I learned on the job, but only the aspects that I needed to get the job done.</p>
                                        <p>I have been a Web developer going 2 years now and I currently work as a Front-End Developer for a recruitment company, creating interactive, responsive website for numerous clients.</p>

                                    <div class="tab-pane" id="android">
                                        <p>Thanks to a Google Scholarship I received at the start of January 2017 and a sucessful completion, I now have a Nanodegree in Android Development. I was selected to study the beginner path as I had no prior knowledge of Android Development, and in just the 6 months I was studying I have created over 10 Android apps.</p>
                                        <p>Now when I open an app on my phone, I am able to understand some if not all of the concepts behind the app. Getting the Scholarship helped me come to a few career decisions and I decided not to go back to work and actually focus on learning and developing my digital skills, it also helped to broaden my life and exposed me to a lot of amazing people all across Europe.</p>
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="tab-pane" id="learning">
                                        <p>I ended up taking 9 months off work between January 2017 - September 2017 to  enriching my knowledge on all things digital. I studied via Udacity for my Scholarship and a variety of online schools and resources, including W3Schools, FreeCodeCamp and CodeAcademy.</p>
                                        <p>I have to say learning via Udacity has definitely been a highlight in my education journey. Udacity Teaching materials really went above and beyond most education journey that I have ever taken.</p>
                                        <p>And with the addition of the freeCodeCamp community and Women TechMakers community’s, I have met some amazing people from all over the world. And I couldn’t be more thankful and grateful for these opportunities and the community’s that I am now a part of.</p>

                                        <p>If I had to describe myself in two words, I feel I am a people person. It has been noted that I am a hardworking, personable, pragmatic, approachable and enthusiastic professional.</p>
                                        <p>So far in my career journey, I like to think that have been incredibly lucky in working for organizations that genuinely care and shared similar values and principles to mine and would also help enrich them. Hence what attracted me to the Co-op, my previous employer. The Co-op was a perfect fit for me because I also have a genuine commitment to social impact and the Co-op values.</p>
                                        <p>I am also someone that eager to learn and develop new skills to achieve the highest standards. While at the Co-op I took part in Agile training to improve and introduce a more Agile way of working, which I think has improved my ability to respond far more quickly to change and provide a way to implement high-priority initiatives. It has also been very useful for learning.</p>
