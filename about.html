        <h1>About me</h1>
        <h3>I am a Junior Software Developer, who specialize in Web and Android development.</h3>
       <p>I am a self-taught Web developer, currently focusing on front end development and aspiring to be a Full-Stack Developer 
         by the end of the year. What lead me down these path is my deep love for coding,  which I discovered while working at the Co-op. 
          My passion for Web development started in my previous role at the Co-op, when my manager gave me a website project to 
          have a look at, to see what needed updating and how to go about making the new changes. This was how I got a taste for 
          developing and I realised I wanted to learn more, so much more.</p>
       <hr> 
        <p>I ended up doing some aspect of Front-End Web development for a year, website (Internet and Intranet) content updating 
          and creating via Episerver CMS (a website content management system). I learned on the job, but only the aspects 
          that I needed to get the job done. I am proficient in Html5 and CSS and I am currently learning Sass,  Jquery, and Reactjs. I have just recently finished 
          learning JavaScript and I understand fundamental JavaScript.</p>
       <hr> 
        <p>I am currently also learning Android Development via Udacity thanks to a Google scholarship I received at the start of the 
          year in January. I completed the first 3 months in April and I have already created 3 Android projects. 
          My projects can be found in my portfolio. I was picked for the second part of the scholarship based on my projects and other requirements. 
          A successful completion of the course in July will entitle me to a Nanodegree in Android Development. 
          I am also proficient in XML and fundamental Java.</p>

<h1>Coding</h1>

<h3>I am currently taking a break from working at the moment to learn but after 5 months off work, I am definitely ready to go back 
  to work and looking for a role as a Junior Software Developer. </h3>
<h3>If you are an employer, do check out my resume and my portfolio. </h3>

<p>I am a versatile programmer with knowledge and interest to learn and code, and in the past 5 months, I have been enriching my 
  knowledge on all things digital. I have completed a course on how to use the command line, using Linux server, 
  Git and Github, Material design, Java, and Javascript.</p>
  <hr> 
<p> I have been studying via Udacity and a variety of online schools and resources, including CodeAcademy. My CodeAcademy profile 
  is linked in my resume, which shows a list of skills I have completed. </p>
<hr> 
<p>I also attended my first live coding event in May at CodeUp Manchester, a once a month mentoring program for adults who would 
  like to learn how to code. It was great to meet like-minded people, who are all on different levels and are all actively learning. 
  It was definitely a change from coding alone in my flat every day. </p>
</div>

<div class="colone">
<h1>Professionally</h1>

<h3>If I had to describe myself in two words, I feel I am a people person. It has been noted that I am a hardworking, 
  personable, pragmatic, approachable and enthusiastic professional. </h3>
<p>I am also someone that likes to get involved, for example in year 10, I was elected the school council representative for my form. 
  It was an experience I really enjoyed so I continued on in my year 11 and university too. I am self-aware and know how to play to 
  my strengths.</p>
  <hr> 
<p>So far in my career journey, I like to think that have been incredibly lucky in working for organizations that genuinely care 
  and shared similar values and principles to mine and would also help enrich them. Hence what attracted me to the Co-op, my previous employer. The Co-op was a perfect fit for me because, I also have a genuine 
  commitment to social impact and the Co-op values, which is evident by my involvement in fundraising and being involved in my 
  local community.</p>
  <hr> 
<p>I am also someone that eager to learn and develop new skills to achieve the highest standards. 
  While at the Co-op I took part in Agile training to improve and introduce a more Agile way of working, which I think has improved 
  my ability to respond far more quickly to change and provide a way to implement high-priority initiatives. 
  It has also been very useful for learning, as it allows me to organize my time well and prioritize. </p>

<div class="coltwo">
<h1>Personally</h1>

<p>I have always loved writing and have recently just started sharing my work. My stories can be found on Medium and in the stories 
  section. I am an avid biker since getting a bike through the cycle to work scheme in July 2016, and according to my bike computer, 
    I have completed 245.10 miles so far.</p> 
<hr> 
<p>I am a very outdoorsy active person. I love hiking, canoeing, rock climbing and swimming is an all time favorite of mine. I love listening to music, art and craft, reading, and spending time with my friends and family, especially my two nephews. 
  Cooking and baking is also something I like to do in my spare time as it is a very creative activity and it helps me relax.
</p>
  <hr> 

<p>I love to travel and experience a different culture. I just came back from an astonishing breathtaking travel to Tokyo and 
  Kyoto in January. I am still tempted to pack up and move to Tokyo. I also visited Cyprus and the Troodos Mountain in March. 
  Pictures can be found in the travel section and if you will like to read more, check out the stories section of my website.
