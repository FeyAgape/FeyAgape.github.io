# A project using Sass. THe Sass is compiled using Gulp. 

### Sass: Overview
Sass has many perks that enable us to write succinct, readable code.

1. Nesting is the process of placing child selectors and properties in the scope of a parent selector. This allows a programmer to draw DOM relationships and avoid repetition.

2. Variables make it easy to update code and reference values by allowing you to assign an identifier to a value.

3. Sass Data Types include:

Numbers
Strings
Booleans
null
Lists
Maps
Nesting and variables are just two ways that Sass keeps stylesheets clean. In the next unit, you'll learn about other Sass constructs that serve the same purpose.
